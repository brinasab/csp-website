    "text": "Assessment\nStudent learning in this course will be assessed primarily through take-home assignments and short in-class quizzes (one per lecture). Assignment 1 is evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis. The other assignments are evaluated using a point system. There will be a total of 10 in-class quizzes, but only the 8 highest scores will count toward your final grade (i.e., the lowest 2 scores will be dropped).\n\nBreakdown\n\n\n\nWhat\nPoints\nGrading Method\n\n\n\n\nAssignment 1\n15\nPass/Fail\n\n\nAssignment 2\n20\nPoints-Based\n\n\nAssignment 3\n20\nPoints-Based\n\n\nIn-Class Quizzes (8 x 5 points)\n40\nPoints-Based\n\n\nAttendance and Participation\n5\nPoints-Based\n\n\nTotal\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading Scheme\nYour final grade is the cumulative score of all submitted work throughout the course. We use the following grading scheme to determine your final grade: A (95-100), A- (90-94), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72). Grades below 70 are dealt on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nDeadlines and Late Submission\nAll assignments are due by 11:59 PM Chicago time. Submit on Canvas the link to your GitHub repository. Each assignment includes a 24-hour grace period during which late submissions will not incur a penalty. After this period, a penalty of one point will be deducted for every additional 24-hour period the assignment is late. Example: If an assignment receives a grade of 20 points and you submit it one day after the grace period ends, your final score will be 19 points.\n\n\nMissed or Incomplete Assignments\nWe expect students to submit all assignments in full and on time.\n\nMissed Assignments: Assignments that are not submitted will receive a grade of 0% and will impact your final grade. If you miss an assignment due to exceptional circumstances (e.g., illness or emergency), please contact me as soon as possible, ideally before the deadline. Extensions may be granted on a case-by-case basis. Note that starting an assignment late or having a busy week does not qualify as an exceptional circumstance.\nIncomplete Assignments: If more than 25% of an assignment is missing, it will not be graded and will be treated as a missed assignment. If less than 25% is missing, the assignment will be graded, with a penalty for each incomplete element.\n\n\n\nRubric\nYour assignments will be evaluated using the rubric below. In addition, each assignment will have specific guidelines that further explain our expectations. These will be posted in the assignment itself.\nYour assignment will score Excellent, Very Good, Good, Needs Improvement, or Not Sufficient on the following five categories:\n\nCoding Style: pertains to stylistic issues, not to whether your code works. It evaluates how well the code follows the R code conventions and how consistent it is. Examples include clarity of the code to read for a person who has not written it, use of comments (code should never be over-commented, nor under-commented), proper variables names, understandable/logical code organization, etc. See here for more and why this matters.\nCoding Strategy: the logic of your code (how it solves the problem); its correctness; sophistication (depth of the solution); use of class tools/techniques (e.g., conditionals, functions, tidyverse); and its efficiency in minimizing repetitions.\nPresentation: for assignments involving data visualization or presentation (tables, graphs, descriptive stats, data analyses), this evaluates the effectiveness of both the graphic execution and the conceptual choices in presenting data. In all assignments, presentation also assesses your proficiency with Markdown syntax.\nAchievement: evaluates your understanding of the concepts/tools required to complete the assignment (how well you master them) and your ability to go beyond the basics; it praises extraordinary work produced in the assignment.\nReproducibility: how well the assignment is in compliance with the course convention for reproducibility in this course (e.g., whether we can access your repo, whether all required elements are submitted, your use of Markdown and RMarkdown, of commit messages, README, etc.)\n\nTo achieve Excellent in a given category, all requirements described above must be satisfied. For the other categories, it might be that only one, or more than one, requirement is missing. For example, you could achieve Very Good on “Coding Style” if you are following all coding conventions, but the code could benefit from more refinement or is inconsistent.\nRoughly “Excellent” translates into A or A+, “Very Good” into A-, “Good” is B or B+, “Needs Improvement” is C, and “Not Sufficient” is below C."

According to the Collegiate Scholars Program Policies, a maximum of two class sections can be missed without penalty. Class starts at 1 PM promptly. If you are late more than 3 times you will not receive credits for attendance.\n\n\nPlagiarism and Academic Integrity\nEach student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Chicago Code of Academic Integrity. Under the provisions of the Code, anyone who gives or receives unauthorized assistance in the preparation of work at home or during tests in class will be subject to disciplinary action. A student’s name on any piece of work is our assurance that they have neither given nor received any unauthorized help in its preparation.\nIn this course, collaboration is encouraged, but plagiarism is prohibited. Students may assist each other on take-home assignments by answering questions and explaining various concepts. However, one student should not allow another student to copy their work directly. it is imperative that students learn how to write code, debug, etc. for themselves. That is, students need to understand, write, and submit their own work. We will run random checks, and if we detect plagiarized code, the whole assignment will be graded as 0.\n\n\nAccessibility and Support\nThe University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry from multiple perspectives. Services and reasonable accommodations are available to persons with temporary and permanent disabilities, to students with DACA or undocumented status, to students facing mental health or other personal challenges, and to students with other kinds of learning challenges. Please, contact me if there are circumstances affecting your ability to participate in class.\nIf you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Student Disability Services for a confidential discussion and for requesting accommodation: SDS. Once SDS approves your accommodation, it will be emailed to both you and me. Please, follow up with me to discuss the necessary logistics of your accommodations. If you need immediate accommodation, please speak with me after class or send an email message to me and SDS.\nSome resources that might be of use include: Office of Student Disability Services, UChicago Student Wellness, Center for Identity and Inclusion."

    "text": "Step 3: Configure Git in RStudio Workbench\nTo make Git work smoothly in this course, you’ll configure these settings: (3.1) Identify yourself to Git with your name and email, so Git can track your work and (3.2) Set up SSH Authentication, so GitHub knows it’s you\nYou only need to do this once per machine!\nYou can also watch a video walkthrough of the setup process.\n\n3.1 Identify yourself to Git\nTo track your work and link changes to you, Git needs to know your name and email address.\nGo to the Console tab in RStudio and run the code below, replacing name and email with your own:\n\nyour name can be your GitHub username or your actual first and last name\nyour email must be the same email you used to sign up for GitHub when you created an account\n\nlibrary(usethis)\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"Your Name\", user.email = \"your@email.com\")\nTo confirm it worked (e.g., that Git got your credentials), go to Tools &gt; Shell and run the following command in the shell/terminal tab that opens up:\ngit config --global --list\nIf you see your name and email, you’re all set. If something looks off—like a typo in your name or you used the wrong email (not the one linked to your GitHub account)—just re-run the R code with the correct information. It will overwrite the previous settings.\n\n\n\n3.2 Set Up SSH Authentication\n\nWhat is this?\nNow Git knows your name and email. But to send your work from Git (on your computer – in our case, Workbench) to GitHub (online), you need to prove to GitHub that’s really you — this is called authentication.\nWhen you log into GitHub in your browser, you use your username and password. But Git uses a different method for authentication: either SSH keys or HTTPS with a personal access token. Both options allow Git to connect to GitHub securely, so you can push and pull changes without entering your password each time.\nSince we are using the RStudio Workbench for the class, you will need to use SSH keys to authenticate. The server that host our Workbench does not have the ability to cache your personal access token for HTTPS.\nThe Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a secure way to prove your identity when connecting to GitHub. Unlike passwords, which can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, SSH keys are much harder to crack.\nWhen you generate an SSH key pair, you get two long strings of characters:\n\na public key, which you upload to GitHub\na private key, which stays safely on your computer (or in RStudio Workbench)\n\nWhen you try to connect to GitHub, Git uses your private key to unlock the connection. If it matches the public key on GitHub, you’re authenticated!\nNote that on GitHub, the URL for SSH looks like git@github.com:&lt;OWNER&gt;/&lt;REPO&gt;.git (make sure you use this SSH URL to create a project or clone a repository. If you accidentally use the HTTPS version, the operation will not work).\n\n\nWhat you need to do to\nYou need to create and store an SSH key pair, by running the following code in your R Console:\ncredentials::ssh_setup_github()\nYou’ll be guided through a few steps:\n\nIt should say “No SSH key found. Generate one now?” → Type Yes\nA long string of characters will appear in the Console, that’s your public SSH key\nYou will be asked to open a browser → Type Yes\nBefore or after opening a new browser, copy the entire SSH key (including the ssh-rsa or ssh-ed25519 at the beginning) from your Console\n\nOnce you are on the GitHub page:\n\nPaste your entire SSH key into the GitHub page that opened in your new browser (you can do this only if you registered a GitHub account, see step 1 above)\nUnder “Title”, give the key an informative name, something like csp-workbench-summer25 or another label to record the course and computer\nLeave “Key type” set to Authentication Key\nClick the green “Add SSH key” button\nIf prompted, complete GitHub’s security steps (e.g., enter a verification code or password or anything else asked)\n\nYou should now see your key listed in your GitHub account!\nTo confirm it worked, go back R, then to Tools &gt; Shell and run the following command in the shell/terminal tab that opens up:\nls -l ~/.ssh\nYou should see two lines showing the keys you just created: id_rsa is your private SSH key (keep it secure and do not share it), your id_rsa.pub is your public SSH key (the one you put on GitHub).\nIf you see more than these two files, it likely means you’ve set up extra SSH keys, which we want to avoid as it might create problems. Please contact us — we’ll help you reset and start fresh!"

Looking at the full distribution gives us a more complete understanding."

    "text": "Overview\nDue: Wednesday, July 2nd by 11:59 PM (Chicago Time)\nThis first homework assignment has two main goals: to verify your computer setup and to practice basic R syntax, Markdown, and R Markdown.\n\n\nAccessing and Cloning Your hw01 Repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis will work only if you have submitted your GitHub username (see Lecture 1) and accepted the email invitation to join our GitHub organization (check the email linked to your GitHub account). Make sure you’ve completed the setup under Software Setup and confirmed everything is working properly.\n\n\nAccessing the repo:\n\nGo at this link to accept the invitation and create your private hw01 repository on GitHub. Your repository will be named hw01-&lt;USERNAME&gt; and will be ready within a few seconds. If this does not work, see the note in red above.\nOnce the repository has been created, click the link provided to access it.\n\nCloning the repo into your Workbench:\n\nLog into Workbench and start a new project:\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git\nIn the Repository URL field:\n\nPaste the URL of your GitHub repository. To find the URL, go to your hw01 repo on GitHub, click the green Code button, and copy the SSH or HTTPS link (use the method you configured during setup: Workbench users must select SSH).\nThe project name should auto-fill. If not, type hw01-&lt;USERNAME&gt; manually.\n\nChoose where to save the project directory locally.\nTip: Use a dedicated folder such as homeworks to keep things organized and avoid moving folders after cloning them\nCheck the box “Open in new session” (optional but recommended for keeping projects separate and organized)\nClick Create Project. This will:\n\nCreate a new folder on your machine\n\nInitialize a Git repository linked to GitHub\n\nOpen an RStudio Project in a new session\n\n\nYou’ll use this same process to access and set up each homework assignment throughout the course.\n\n\nGeneral Homework Workflow\nYour workflow for all homework assignments will follow these steps:\n\nAccept the GitHub repo invitation and clone the repo (see above)\nEdit the files included in the repo\nSave your changes locally in RStudio Workbench\nPull – Stage – Commit – Push:\n\nPull from GitHub: this should not change anything if you’re the only one working on the repo, but it’s a good habit to always pull first\nStage and commit your changes to your local Git repository\nPush your committed changes to your GitHub repository online\n\n\nFor this course, I assume you’ll be using the Git interface built into RStudio. If you haven’t yet, complete the Using Git within RStudio tutorial to get comfortable with the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nCommit and push your work often—multiple times per session if possible. Don’t wait until you’ve finished the entire assignment.\n\nNever edit files directly on GitHub. Always work in your local Git repository (e.g., on Workbench) and then push changes to GitHub. Think of your GitHub repo as a live online backup of your local project.\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Types Used for Homework Assigments\nAll assignments in this course will be completed and submitted using Markdown and R Markdown files:\n\nMarkdown (.md) is a lightweight formatting language used to structure text.\n\nGitHub README files are typically written in Markdown (.md) or plain text (.txt).\nIn this course, we use Markdown files only for writing README files because GitHub renders them directly in the browser.\nYou can reference R code in Markdown, but you cannot run and execute it.\n\nR Markdown (.Rmd) is a format that allows you to combine R code, output, and text in one file.\n\nIt’s an extension of Markdown designed for dynamic analysis and reproducible reports specifically for R.\nYou’ll use R Markdown to complete most homework assignments.\n\n\nIn short, for this course:\n\nUse Markdown (.md) only for writing a short summary in the README.md file\nUse R Markdown (.Rmd) for completing the bulk of your assignment, e.g., analysis and code-based work\n\n\n\nAssignment Description\nFor this first assignment, you’ll edit and push the following two files to your GitHub repo: README.md and code.rmd\n\nEdit the README.md file\nYou will see a file named README.md in your repository.\nA README is usually a plain text (.txt) or Markdown (.md) file that provides important information about a project—such as a summary, installation steps, or example output. In this course, you’ll use it to document your work and reflect on your process.\nYour Task: edit the README.md file by replacing the placeholder text with a short biography of yourself. To achieve a “pass”, your biography must include the following elements:\n\nAt least one header\nSome emphasis (italic or bold text)\nAt least one list\nAn image (e.g., a photo of yourself or something meaningful to you)\n\nUpload the image into your repo by importing it in Workbench\n\nEmbed it in the Markdown file using the correct syntax\n\nAt least one link (e.g., to a website or profile)\n\nAt the end of your README, add a short reflection that includes:\n\nA brief summary of your Git/GitHub workflow for this homework\n(Bullet points or a short narrative are both fine.)\nYour evaluation of the homework experience\n(E.g., something new you learned, what went well, what confused you, etc.)\nA list of resources you consulted\n(Include links, tools, and names of any collaborators. If you used AI tools, briefly describe how.)\n\n\n\nEdit the code.rmd file\nYou will see a file named code.rmd in your repository.\nYour task: edit the code.rmd file by making the following changes (all must be included for a “pass”):\n\nAdd at least two new YAML header options:\n\nDo not delete or modify the existing ones\nExample additions: author:, subtitle:, toc: true, etc\n\nFeel free to experiment, see readings and slides from Lecture 1 for ideas\n\nAdd at least two R code chunks with a short explanation in plain text (not as code comment):\n\nYour code can be simple (think at the examples from lecture 1), but it must run and produce the correct output\nYour final knitted .html file should show both code and output\nIf your code generates plots (not required, but possible), make sure the output images are also pushed to GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the Assignment\nTo submit your assignment on Canvas, follow these steps:\n\nBefore the deadline, push the final version of your work to your GitHub repository. Tip: don’t wait until the end to make your first commit—commit, stage, and push your work regularly as you go.\nYour GitHub repository should include:\n\nThe updated README.md\nThe edited code.rmd\nA knitted output file generated from code.rmd (this must be a .md document, not anything else)\n\nWhen you’re ready to submit:\n\nCopy the URL of your GitHub repository. It will look something like: https://github.com/csp-summer25/hw01-yourusername\nSubmit that URL on Canvas under HW01. Do not upload any files to Canvas. We only need the repository link.\n\n\n\n\nAssessment\nThis assignment is evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis. To earn a Pass:\nYour README.md should include a clear introduction that meets all specified requirements. It should demonstrate your ability to use Markdown syntax, such as headers, emphasis, lists, links, and images. You should also include a short description of how you edited and committed your changes, along with reflections on your experience using Git/GitHub, Markdown, and R Markdown.\nYour code.rmd file must knit successfully. It should contain at least two new YAML header fields and two R code chunks, each introduced with a brief explanation written as plain text (not as code comments).\nAll required files must be pushed to your GitHub repository.\nFor more details, see the Assessment section of the Syllabus."

    "title": "HW02: Exploring Data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nDue: Thursday, July 17th by 11:59 PM (Chicago Time)\nIn the first assignment you have demonstrated knowledge of your software setup, Git/GitHub via RStudio, and R Markdown.\nThe goal of this second assignment is to practice transforming and exploring data with dplyr and ggplot2.\n\n\nAccessing and Cloning Your hw02 Repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis will work only if you have submitted your GitHub username (see Lecture 1) and accepted the email invitation to join our GitHub organization (check the email linked to your GitHub account). Make sure you’ve completed the setup under Software Setup and confirmed everything is working properly.\n\n\nAccessing the repo:\n\nGo at this link to accept the invitation and create your private hw02 repository on GitHub. Your repository will be named hw02-&lt;USERNAME&gt; and will be ready within a few seconds. If this does not work, see the note in red above.\nOnce the repository has been created, click the link provided to access it.\n\nCloning the repo into your Workbench:\n\nLog into Workbench and start a new project:\nFile &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git\nIn the Repository URL field:\n\nPaste the URL of your GitHub repository. To find the URL, go to your hw02 repo on GitHub, click the green Code button, and copy the SSH or HTTPS link (use the method you configured during setup: Workbench users must select SSH).\nThe project name should auto-fill. If not, type hw02-&lt;USERNAME&gt; manually.\n\nChoose where to save the project directory locally.\nTip: Use a dedicated folder such as homeworks to keep things organized and avoid moving folders after cloning them\nCheck the box “Open in new session” (optional but recommended for keeping projects separate and organized)\nClick Create Project. This will:\n\nCreate a new folder on your machine\n\nInitialize a Git repository linked to GitHub\n\nOpen an RStudio Project in a new session\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Homework Workflow\nSee Homework 1 for details. The workflow is the same for all assignments (e.g., accept the repo, edit the files, save, then Pull – Stage – Commit – Push).\n\n\nAssignment Description\n\nThe mass shooting dataset\nThe United States experiences far more mass shooting events than any other developed country in the world. Policymakers, politicians, the media, activists, and the general public acknowledge the widespread prevalence of these events. However, effective policies to prevent such incidents should be grounded in empirical data.\nIn July 2012, in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, Mother Jones published a report on mass shootings in the United States since 1982. Importantly, they provided the underlying data set as an open-source database for anyone interested in studying and understanding the topic.\nThis dataset is already installed on Workbench.\n\n\n\nAnswer the questions\nYour repository includes specific and open-ended questions. Answer all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe questions—especially the open-ended ones—are designed to help you think like a university student and future researcher. They won’t walk you through every step but encourage you to apply what you’ve learned and work independently.\nPlan to complete this over multiple sessions. Start early, and remember to save, commit, and push your work regularly.\nDo not use AI tools to generate R code from scratch. You may use it to debug (after trying on your own ) or look up how functions work (check course materials first). Only submit code you fully understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormatting Guide\n\nFormatting graphs\nWhile you are practicing Exploratory Data Analysis, your final graphs should be appropriate for sharing with outsiders. That means your graphs should have:\n\nA title\nLabels on the axes (type ?labs in your Console for details)\n\nConsider adopting your own color scales, taking control of your legends (if any), playing around with themes, and generally customizing your graphs to improve their visual appeal and clarity.\n\n\nFormatting tables\nWhen presenting tabular data (using dplyr::summarize()), consider using the kable() function from the knitr package to format the table for the final document. Here is how you use this function.\nThe code below displays a basic table summarizing where gun deaths occurred:\n\n# calculate total gun deaths by location\ncount(mass_shootings, location_type)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  location_type     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 Airport           1\n2 Military          6\n3 Other            49\n4 Religious         6\n5 School           18\n6 Workplace        45\n\n\nThis is the same code but we added kable() to format the table, add a caption, and label the columns. Observe what it does:\n\ncount(mass_shootings, location_type) %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Mass shootings in the United States by location\",\n    col.names = c(\"Location\", \"Number of incidents\")\n  )\n\n\nMass shootings in the United States by location\n\n\nLocation\nNumber of incidents\n\n\n\n\nAirport\n1\n\n\nMilitary\n6\n\n\nOther\n49\n\n\nReligious\n6\n\n\nSchool\n18\n\n\nWorkplace\n45\n\n\n\n\n\nRun ?kable in your Console for additional options\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the Assignment\nTo submit your assignment on Canvas, follow these steps:\n\nBefore the deadline, push the final version of your work to your GitHub repository. Tip: don’t wait until the end to make your first commit—commit, stage, and push your work regularly as you go.\nYour GitHub repository should include (ake sure to stage-commit-push all these files):\n\nmass-shootings.Rmd: main file you will work on\nmass-shootings.md: you will generate this file from the .Rmd by simply knitting it, like you did for HW01 (do not modify the output format)\nmass-shootings_files/: this folder contains all the graphs that you generated in your .Rmd\n\nWhen you’re ready to submit:\n\nCopy the URL of your GitHub repository. It will look something like: https://github.com/csp-summer25/hw02-yourusername\nSubmit that URL on Canvas under HW02. Do not upload any files to Canvas. We only need the repository link.\n\n\n\n\nAssessment\nAll homework assignments are evaluated using a rubric (for more details, see the Assessment section of the Syllabus). Below are further guidelines for this specific homework to help you assess your work before submitting it.\nIn the past, “Excellent” or “Very Good” work included submissions that:\n\nCompleted all parts of the assignment correctly and accurately.\nIncluded code that:\n\nRan without errors\nFollowed good style (clean, readable, well-organized)\nWas well-documented but not over-commented\nUsed appropriate complexity and matched the prompt and course content\nDemonstrated understanding of key concepts and functions\n\nIncluded graphs and tables that were:\n\nWell-chosen for the variable types\nClearly labeled, visually polished, and customized beyond defaults\nInterpreted in a clear and concise analysis\n\nShowed strong use of:\n\nRequired packages, showing curiosity to use them beyond the basics\nR Markdown syntax (e.g., no rendering errors, appropriate use of syntax, etc.)\n\nFollowed good GitHub practices:\n\nMultiple informative commits showing progress over time\nAll required files present and displaying correctly, including rendered graphs"

Cloning means downloading a local copy of the repository.\nIn Workbench, start a new Git Project with Version Control: File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git\nIf the Version Control option is missing, return to Step 1 to ensure RStudio can find Git. Otherwise, fill out the following fields:\n\nRepository URL: paste the URL of your new GitHub repository (see Step 2)\nProject directory name: it should automatically populate, do not change it. If it does not automatically populate, type the same name you gave to your GitHub repository (e.g. myrepo)\nCreate project as subdirectory of: click on “Browse…” and decide where to store the local directory for the project. It is OK to leave this test directory under Home\nBefore proceeding, check the Open in new session box situated toward the bottom, as that’s what you’ll usually do in real life\nFinally, click Create Project. The first time you do it, you might get the following message: “The authenticity of host ‘github.com (IP)’ can’t be established etc.” If so:\n\nEnsure that the hash shown in the message matches one of those shown here\nIf the hash matches (it should), type “yes” and you are done. If you do not see the hash, open the shell and type: ssh -T git@github.com\nIf you answered “yes” but get a message like\n\"Permission denied. fatal: Could not read from remote repository\"\nit likely means Git is not configured correctly — go back and configure it.\n\n\nYour Project has been created!\nNotice that your project in RStudio (e.g., Workbench) matches the one on GitHub (go to your GitHub page which should be open in your brownser and compare). The visual presentation may look different, but the files and their content should always be the same. A Project will now be:\n\na directory on your computer\na Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository\nan RStudio Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhenever possible, use this workflow — starting with GitHub and then connecting through RStudio — as your preferred method for setting up R projects.\nThe advantage of this “GitHub first, then Git in RStudio” workflow is that your remote GitHub repository is automatically set as the upstream for your local repository. This means you can push and pull commits right away, without any extra configuration.\nIt is also possibile to do the reverse setup (starting locally and connecting to GitHub later), see the Alternative to Step 3 below for details."

    "text": "Git and GitHub\nGit and GitHub are powerful tools for managing and sharing your work and code. They are often used together, but they are not the same thing: Git is a version control system, GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage your Git repositories.\nKeep reading to learn more about them, and see the book Happy Git and GitHub for the useR for further info.\n\nGit is a version control system\nGit is a version control system that tracks changes in a project over time so that there is always a comprehensive, structured record of that project. Each project is stored in a repository which contains all files that are part of the project (e.g., code scripts but also data files, reports, and source code).\nWhy using Git?\nIn this course (and in your own work), you will be writing lots of programs. Generally the first draft is not the final draft, be it a research paper or a computer script. We want a way to track our changes over time. Perhaps this is to make sure we have a record of what we’ve already done that doesn’t work, so we can avoid doing it again. Or maybe we want to share our code with collaborators who are working on a project with us. How can we do this?\nOne potential solution is to email copies of files back and forth as we make changes. But if we do this, we risk having lots of versions of files floating around. How do we know which is the most recent? What happens if someone edits a file and forgets to email it to us? How will we make sure all the changes are merged into the final version?\nOr perhaps instead we can do all of our work on a cloud-based storage solution such as Dropbox or Google Drive. This ensures changes are synchronized between computers. But they are not specifically designed to share code, and we won’t always know who made what changes to a file. And what happens if two people want to work on the same file at the same time? One person will have to wait for the other to finish before they can edit that file. Plus how will we track previous versions of the file? Dropbox and other cloud storage services have some version control solutions, but these are not comprehensive or only store versions for a limited time. Plus every time we save a new version of the program, the entire file has to be retained. On large projects, this will eat up storage space quickly.\nWe want a solution (Git!) that:\n\nKeeps old versions of files indefinitely. Since all these versions are stored, we can always go back and see who modified the file and what changes they made. Or if we make a mistake in the future that breaks the program, we can revert back to an older version to fix it.\nSince we know who modified each file, if we have questions in the future we can go to that person with our questions.\nWhen collaborating with multiple people on the same project, and when code is involved, we want any changes made by project members to be integrated to the most recent version. If I try to modify a file and don’t incorporate another member’s revisions, I need to be told there is a conflict so I can merge all the changes.\n\n\n\nGitHub is a hosting service\nGitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that hosts and lets you manage your Git repositories. See GitHub on Wikipedia for more.\nAlthough Git and GitHub are often used together, you do not need GitHub to use Git: * Git can be used locally by you on a single computer to track changes in a project. You do not need to be connected to the internet to use Git, and you do not need GitHub to use Git. But GitHub allows you to save your repositories online and share your work with a larger audience (you can host public or private repositories there) * You could put your Git repositories somewhere else online: GitHub is not the only option to host and mange Git repositories, but its the most popular one. Alternatives include Bitbucket, TaraVault, GitLab, etc.\nProfessionally, you should know how to use Git and GitHub to manage projects and share code. This is why we will use Git and GitHub to host our course site, share code, and distribute/collect assignments."

    "title": "Tools for R Programming and Collaboration",
    "section": "Shell",
    "text": "Shell\nThe shell (or bash or terminal) is a program on your computer whose job is to run other programs, rather than do calculations itself. The shell is a very old program and in a time before the mouse it was the only way to interact with a computer. It is still extremely popular among programmers because it is fast and powerful at automating repetitive tasks.\nHere we use the shell for a more modest goal: to navigate the file system, confirm the present working directory, and cement the git to GitHub connection.\n\nStarting the shell\nIn RStudio, go to Tools &gt; Shell. This should take you to the shell (on Mac: Terminal, on Windows: GitBash or equivalent). It should be a simple blinking cursor, waiting for input (white text on black background, or black text on white background)\n\n\nUsing the shell\nThe most basic commands are listed below:\n\npwd (print working directory). Shows the folder (or directory) you are currently operating in. This is not necessarily the same as the R working directory you get from getwd().\nls (list all files). Shows all files in the current working directory. This is equivalent to looking at the files in your Finder/Explorer/File Manager. Use ls -a to also list hidden files, such as .Rhistory and .git.\ncd (change directory). Allows you to navigate through your folders by changing the shell’s working directory. You can navigate like so:\n\ngo to subfolder foo of current working directory: cd foo\ngo to parent folder of current working directory: cd ..\ngo to home folder: cd ~ or simply cd\ngo to folder using absolute path, works regardless of your current working directory: cd /home/my_username/Desktop. Windows uses a slightly different syntax with the slashes between the folder names reversed, \\, e.g. cd C:\\Users\\MY_USERNAME\\Desktop.\n\nTip 1: Dragging and dropping a file or folder into the terminal window will paste the absolute path into the window.\nTip 2: Use the tab key to autocomplete unambiguous folder and file names. Hit tab twice to see all ambiguous options.\n\n\nUse arrow-up and arrow-down to repeat previous commands. Or search for previous commands with CTRL+r.\ngit status is the most used git command and informs you of your current branch, any changes or untracked files, and whether you are in sync with your remotes.\ngit remote -v lists all remotes. Very useful for making sure git knows about your remote and that the remote address is correct.\ngit remote add origin GITHUB_URL adds the remote GITHUB_URL with nickname origin.\ngit remote set-url origin GITHUB_URL changes the remote url of origin to GITHUB_URL. This way you can fix typos in the remote url.\n\n\n\nA note for Windows users\nOn Windows, the program that runs the shell is called Command Prompt or cmd.exe.\nUnfortunately, the default Windows shell does not support all the commands that other operating systems do. This is where GitBash comes in handy: it installs a light version of a shell that does support all the above commands. When you access the shell through RStudio, RStudio actually tries to open GitBash if it can find it, but it will open the default Windows Command Prompt if GitBash is not found.\nIf you get an error message such as `pwd is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.` from any of the previous commands, that means that RStudio could not find GitBash. The most likely cause of this is that you did not install git using the recommended method so try re-installing git.\nIf you followed the installation instructions and still cannot run GitBash, you should find it under “Menu &gt; Git &gt; Git Bash”. If you’re still confused, go back and watch the first three minutes of this video tutorial on installing Git for Windows."

If you don’t handle them properly, R will throw errors when you try to use them.\nWhat to Do:\n1. Use backticks to refer to them (e.g., `Flipper Length (mm)`)\n2. Use rename() to change them to syntactic names\nNon-syntactic names will break code if you forget to wrape them in backticks, so renaming avoids issues."
