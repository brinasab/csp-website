## Course Objectives {.no-fragment}

The goal of this course is to acquire basic computational skills. Specifically:

1.  Learning R, especially the "tidyverse"
2.  Learning best practices for reproducible research

::: fragment
You won't become an R expert in a few weeks, BUT you will:

-   learn the basics and gain confidence to explore new techniques beyond this course

-   use R as a tool for analyzing social science data
:::

---

## Course Topics

<!--* Debugging and Defensive Programming * Reproducible Research * Web-Scraping -->

Main topics of this course:

-   Git/GitHub via RStudio
-   R Markdown
-   Data Visualization
-   Data Cleaning and Transformation
-   Exploratory Data Analysis
-   R Programming: Control Structures, Data Structures, etc.

---

## How We'll Do This

We start simple and build toward more complex code

```{r hello-world, echo = TRUE}
# create a variable and print it
x <- "Hello!"
print(x)
```

<br>

We use a mix of lectures, in-class activities, assignments (take-home and in-class), and we rely on several platforms (e.g., course website, Canvas, Ed Discussion, Workbench, Git/GitHub, and Markdown). 

All course materials are free and accessible from our website.

```{=html}
<!-- IN CLASS

A lot to take in at first but after week 1 things should go smoothly and if not reach out; on homework: most of your learning will happen there!

You will encounter errors while coding and there will be moments of frustration. That's expected and part of learning. Be patient with yourself!

You will spend time finding resources to help: 
Google, ChatGPT are OK (within limits, more on this later)...but the documentation and the class materials should be the first places to go!

-->
```

</br>

---

## Homework and Evaluation

See "Assessment" from our Syllabus and the [Course Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CmuUXTp0uvhAVk3mmOQMEfb8BjdR-I36/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112534119211880791899&rtpof=true&sd=true):

-   **Assessment and Evaluation:**  There will be short quizzes in class and take-home assignments. Check the syllabus for the grading rubric and more details
-   **Arrive on Time:** Each class starts right at 1:00 PM with a quick quiz. These are short and meant to help you stay on track, so be here and ready to go by 1:00 PM.
-   **Submission Policies:**  Info on how we handle late or missed assignments is in the syllabus.


```{=html}
<!--
* **Weekly programming assignments and Final Project**: see [here](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/homework/) 

* **Submission Policies** for missed assignments, late work, etc.: see [here](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/homework-evaluations/#missed-assignments-resubmission-late-work-etc)

* **Evaluation Philosophy and Rubric**: see [here](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/faq/homework-evaluations/#evaluation-philosophy)


**Tips**:

* do the readings before class, even if you do not understand everything
* start early to work on the homework assignments 
* assignments (starting from the 2nd) will be a bit challenging, especially if you have never programmed before: they won't tell you exactly what to do to solve the problem
* submit code that runs 
* form a study group, and ask for help if you get stuck

-->
```

## Software Setup

Next lecture we will learn the basics of Git and GitHub and complete the Software Setup for the course. 

Weâ€™ll be working in **RStudio Workbench**, which is cloud-based version of RStudio that runs in your browser. 

Check our website under "Software Setup" for details.

<!--

Go to [Setup](https://computing-soc-sci.netlify.app/setup/) in our course website and follow the instructions in the order provided there.

You have two options:

1.  **Option required for beginners; strongly recommended for others:** use RStudio Workbench
2.  **Only if you have already experience with programming and talk to me first:** install the software locally on your own machine 

::: {.fragment .setup-box .callout-important}
**Complete the setup before the next lecture!**

If you're having trouble with the setup, stay after class or come to Office Hours. Note that only enrolled students have access to R Workbench.
:::

-->

---

## Activity: Meet & Share Goals

**In groups of 4-5 people, please share:**

-   Your name, plus something about yourself that youâ€™re comfortable sharing (e.g., a hobby, your favorite food, your high school, your experience with programming, etc.)
-   What you hope to learn or achieve in this course
-   Any questions or concerns you have, and strategies you plan to use to stay on track (weâ€™ll go around the room and answer questions)

::: {.callout-note title="Done early?"}
If your group finishes early, please complete [this short survey](https://forms.gle/pY7sCoCVEDEe7bYD7) if you havenâ€™t already. It only takes a minute and helps us better understand your background and what youâ€™re hoping to learn in this course.
:::

---

## Yes to Collaboration, No to Copying

Researchers collaborate on projects. Developers work in teams to write programs. AI is becoming part of our daily and academic lives.

::: fragment
**â†’ Collaboration is good and encouraged, but in this course you are also expected to:**

-   Complete your own work individually
-   Write your code and fully understand it
-   Be ready to explain your code line-by-line to someone else
:::

---

## Collaboration vs. Plagiarism {.center}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### âœ… DO:

-   Discuss and debug with peers
-   Rewrite code found online in your own style<br> and cite the source</br>
-   Use AI to help debug or clarify concepts
-   Submit code you wrote
-   Submit code you fully understand
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### ðŸš« DON'T:

-   Copy code from your classmaters or others
-   Simply copy and paste chunks of code from<br> the internet</br>
-   Ask AI to write code for you
-   Submit code you didn't write
-   Submit code you can't explain
:::
:::::

```{=html}
<!--
### Resource Disclosure

In your homework, list any help or resources you used.  
For example:  
- *"I collaborated with First Lastname on debugging"*  
- *"I used ChatGPT to understand how to plot a bar chart"*
-->
```

## Tips from former students...

::: fragment
-   "One of the hardest things for me was remembering where I saw a concept or piece of code."<br>*Advice: Stay organized (e.g., customize slides and notes, and create your own system to retrieve info)!*
:::

::: fragment
-   "Homework took more time and effort than I expected." <br>*Advice: Start early! You donâ€™t need to know everything before you begin: just get started and review the materials as needed. Complete the in-class exercises before tackling a homework.*
:::

::: fragment
-   "Iâ€™m in week 4, and I feel lost."<br>*Advice: Reach out to us! Concepts build over time. The big picture will click IF you stay consistent with your efforts every week.*
:::

::: fragment
-   "I found code that worked but wasnâ€™t covered in class, so I wasnâ€™t sure whether to use it."<br>*Advice: Stick to class syntax and functions â€” theyâ€™re chosen for a reason. But you can show both approaches by comparing the function(s) covered in class with your own.*
:::

```{=html}
<!-- IN CLASS: 
Share some further tips to be successful

pen and paper! make a plan before you code

keep things organized! e.g. all your slides and RMd files, customize them know where to find what and when we covered it (vs chatGPt...)

say everyone who puts effort and works hard on this class has gotten at least a B+ and usually in the A range

Add to point above a version of the following: HWs assignments are take-home with no limited time and open-books, as such they are designed to be more challenging that in-class exercises

Add one question on Make at habit to go to Office Hours and post on Ed this is the type of class for which OHs are a key element. That's why we offer more OHs opportunities than the average class

Use the drop-in and by appointment model as in Fall 2024 and ask TAs to schedule OHs before HW are due and aim at covering all days
-->
```

# 2. Intro to R, RStudio, and Workbench {.slide .center .middle}

---

## What Are These Tools?

| Tool | What It Is |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **R** | A programming language for data analysis, statistics, and visualization. |
| **RStudio** | A user-friendly interface (IDE) for using R. |
| **Workbench** | A cloud-based version of R/RStudio with everything pre-installed. We will use it in this course to minimize setup issues. |

---

## Letâ€™s start by exploring our Software

**Workbench:** <https://macss-r.uchicago.edu/>

-   Log in
-   Look at panels
-   How to export/import files between Workbench and your machine
-   Create an empty R Script

```{=html}
<!-- IN CLASS

Open Workbench link: log in, start new session

Describe the panels:
Start from console, type in simple code, show it shows up in environment. 

Move to file, say this is where you communicate btw your computer and workbench, for example import a file from my machine into R workbench (e.g. with class roster on desktop), create a class-materials folder to keep things organized

Then create a R script, save it in class materials: show difference compared to previously typed code in console (now is saved)

Create a Rmd as empty doc, stop here, move back to slides say: let's talk about R markdown first! I might go a bit fast on some of these slides but we ll be there for your reference. We ll do an in-class activity that ll review same content taught here
-->
```

---

## Getting Started with R

Today we learn how to:

-   Use R as a calculator\
-   Create and use variables\
-   Understand variable types (e.g., number, text, logical, etc.)\
-   Write comments and organize your code\
-   Use scripts (vs. console) for reproducibility\
-   Clear your environment\
-   Fix common errors\
-   Group values using vectors

---

## ðŸ’» Live Coding Activity to get Started with R

We learn all of this via a live coding activity:

-   Log into Workbench <https://macss-r.uchicago.edu/>
-   Type along with me as we write and run code together
-   Stop me anytime if you have questions

```{=html}
<!-- IN CLASS:
Youâ€™ll run into errors and typos, thatâ€™s part of the process -->
```

# 3. R Markdown {.slide .center .middle}

---

## Deep Dive on R Markown

R Markdown is a file format (with extension `.Rmd`) that combines R code, using code chunks, and text in a single document. It's very popular because it makes it easy to create reproducible reports, analyses, and presentations.

You might hear about Quarto (with extension `.qmd`), which is a newer alternative to R Markdown. We wonâ€™t cover it, but if you know R Markdown, you can quickly adjust to Quarto.

---

## Comparing R Scripts, R Markdown, and Markdown {.center}

| File Type  | Extension | Key Differences                  |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| R Script   | `.R`      | Supports code                    |
| R Markdown | `.Rmd`    | Supports code and formatted text |
| Markdown   | `.md`     | Supports formatted text          |

We use all three, but mainly `.Rmd` for assignments and `.md` for Git/GitHub documentation.

```{=html}
<!-- IN CLASS:
Let's open each one and explore their key differences!
Open Workbench and create a file of each type, see the difference 
SAY: on md you can type code but it is not evaluated/executed, basically is text
R Markdown: an extension of Markdown designed for R -->
```

## R Markdown: Three Main Components

1.  **YAML header** for document title, author, output format, etc. Insert it at the top between `---`

2.  **Text** regular Markdown for headers, lists, links, etc.

3.  **Code chunks** for code. Insert it with triple backticks ```` ``` ````

::: {.fragment .setup-box .callout-tip title="Code Chunk Tips"}
[<strong>Three ways to insert a code chunk in your R Markdown:</strong>]{style="font-size: 1.2em"}

-   Use the RStudio toolbar\
-   Type manually ```` ```{r} ```` and ```` ``` ````
-   Use a shortcut
    -   Mac: âŒ˜ + âŒ¥ + I\
    -   Windows: Ctrl + Alt + I
:::

---

## R Markdown: Example

This is what we type (YAML, text, code):

````{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Homework 1"
author: "Sabrina Nardin"
output: html_document
---

I write my homework description here. 
I can format the text in many ways, for example, by bolding **key concepts**.

```{r}
# create a variable
x <- 5
```
````


```{=html}
<!-- IN CLASS: 
copy this on a blank Rmd document on Workbench and render it -->
```

---

## YAML: **Y**et **A**nother **M**arkup **L**anguage

The YAML header sits at the top of your `.Rmd` and tells R what the document is about and how to display it (e.g., as a html, PDF, Word, etc.).

The example below shows only three fields but many more can be added:

```{verbatim, echo = TRUE}
---
title: "Homework 1"
author: "Sabrina Nardin"
output: html_document
---
```

```{=html}
<!-- IN CLASS: 
Change output to word and observe diffrence. Say that pdf might give problems occasionally due to an additonal package needed which is latex
-->
```

### Output

*Italics*\
**Bold**\
~~Strikethrough~~\
`inline code`
:::
:::::

`````{=html}
<!--

## R Markdown: Basic Syntax

**Use a backslash `\` to make R Markdown special characters visible, e.g., to interpret them literally:**

--

````
I want to use \* for emphasis, not for italics: \*great\*
````
I want to use \* for emphasis, not for italics: \*great\*

## \# in Code vs. Markdown Text

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### In Code

``` r
# Assign number to variable
x <- 5 
# Assign text to variable
name <- "Sabrina"
```

-   `#` starts a **COMMENT** in R Scripts and R Markdown Code Chunks
-   Comments are **ignored** when the code runs
-   Use one single `#` for code explanations or debugging, space doesn't matter
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### In R Markdown Text

``` markdown
# Title (h1)
## Section (h2)
### Subsection (h3)
#### More Subsections (h4)
```

-   `#` creates a **HEADER** in Markdown or R Markdown Text
-   The number of `#` signs = **heading level**
-   Use as many `#` as needed for organizing document sections, space matters

## R Markdown: Handy Code Chunk Options {.center}

::: small
| Option | What it does | Default |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| `eval = FALSE` | Code is not run, only shown; results do not appear. Useful for code examples or showing code with errors. | `eval = TRUE` |
| `include = FALSE` | Code is run, but both code and results are hidden. Useful for setup code you don't want to display. | `include = TRUE` |
| `echo = FALSE` | Code is run, results are shown, but code is hidden. Good when readers only need the output. | `echo = TRUE` |
| `error = TRUE` | Code is run and shown, even if it throws an error. Useful when demonstrating broken code. | `error = FALSE` |
| `message = FALSE` / `warning = FALSE` | Code is run, but messages and warnings are hidden from the output. | `message = TRUE` / `warning = TRUE` |
:::

Check [this table](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html#chunk-options) and [options](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/) for more.

<!--

**`eval = FALSE`** code is not evaluated; code appears in the report, results do not appear in the report. Useful to show an example code in your report, or when code has an error you want to show. Default is `eval = TRUE`

**`include = FALSE`** code is evaluated; code does not appear in the report, nor do results. Useful when you do not want to clutter your report with too much code. Default is `include = TRUE`

**`echo = FALSE`** code is evaluated; code does not appear in the report, results appear in the report. Useful to show your output to people that are not interested in the code that produced it. Default is `echo = TRUE`

**`error = TRUE`** code is evaluated and output appears in the report even if there is an error. Useful to knit with errors. Default is `error = FALSE`

**`message = FALSE`** or **`warning = FALSE`** prevents messages or warnings from appearing in the report. Default is `message = TRUE` or `warning = TRUE`

-->

## Rendering R Markdown Documents

R Markdown lets you create documents that combine text, code, and output, and "render" or "knit" them in formats like html, pdf, word, and more.

::: {.fragment .setup-box .callout-tip title="Rendering Tips"}
[<strong>Three ways to render your R Markdown document:</strong>]{style="font-size: 1.2em"}

-   **Click "Knit"** in RStudio and choose an output

-   **Set the format in the YAML header** such as `html_document`,`word_document`, `pdf_document`, `github_document`, etc.

-   **Use `render()`** in your console by typing `rmarkdown::render("my-document.Rmd", output_format: html_document`). More info [here](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/rmarkdown/reference/render.html)
:::

---

## R Markdown: Knitting process

When you "knit" your document, the following sequential things happen:

1.  R Markdown sends the `.Rmd` file to `knitr` http://yihui.name/knitr/

2.  Knitr executes all of the code chunks and creates a new plain Markdown `.md` file which includes the code and its output

3.  This plain Markdown file is then converted by `pandoc` into any number of output types including html, PDF, Word document, etc.: http://pandoc.org/

```{r}
#include_graphics(path = "rmarkdownflow.png")
```
