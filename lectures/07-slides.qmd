# 1. Renaming and Recoding Variables {.slide .center .middle}

---

## Definitions

**Renaming**: change variable names (column names)

**Recoding**: change values/levels of categorical variables (column values; e.g., inside a column)

---

## Uses

**What are some common scenarios where youâ€™d want to rename variable names or recode variable values?**

- You are cleaning up imported data 
  - The variable name is has issues (e.g., `Flipper Length (mm)` â†’ `flipper_length_mm`)
  - You need to standardize categories (e.g., `"Good"` and `"GOOD"` â†’ `"good"`)
  - Etc.
- You are preparing data for modeling or visualization
  - You want to recode `"FEMALE"`/`"MALE"` to `0`/`1` for a regression model  
  - Etc.

---

## We work with the Penguins (raw) Data!

```r
# Load libraries and data
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)

# Explore data
head(penguins_raw)
tail(penguins_raw)
rbind(head(penguins_raw, 3), tail(penguins_raw, 3))
glimpse(penguins_raw)
```

---

## Renaming Variables with rename

To change variable names (column names) the most common method is `rename()` 

Change the name of the variable `studyName` to `study_name`:

```r
# check before renaming
str(penguins_raw)
penguins_raw %>% select(studyName)

# rename
penguins_raw %>% rename(study_name = studyName)   # new = old

# remember to save to keep changes
p <- penguins_raw %>% rename(study_name = studyName)
p %>% select(study_name)
```
---

## ðŸ’» Practice Renaming Variables

- Use `select()` to check the variable `Comments` in `penguins_raw` 
- Use `rename()` to rename `Comments` to `notes`
- Save the result to a new object
- Use `select()` to check your result

Once done, copy your code [here](https://codeshare.io/29X3QM){target="_blank"} to share it.

<!--
select(penguins_raw, Comments)
penguins_raw |> rename(notes = Comments)
-->

---

## Recoding Variables Method 1: with mutate + recode

To change variable values (usually levels of categorical variables), we learn two methods.

Change the levels of the categorical variable `Sex` (MALE becomes 1, FEMALE becomes 0) with method 1:

```r
# check before recoding
penguins_raw %>% count(Sex)

# mutate + recode
p <- penguins_raw %>%
  mutate(sex = recode(Sex, "MALE" = 1, "FEMALE" = 0))

# compare
penguins_raw %>% count(Sex)
p %>% count(Sex)

```

<!-- Here we could have unquoted (e.g., `MALE = 1`) but only works if: 
the variable is a factor or there are no spaces or punctuation in the variable name -->

---

## Recoding Variables Method 2: with mutate + case_when

Change the levels of the categorical variable `Sex` (MALE becomes 1, FEMALE becomes 0) with method 2:

```r
# mutate + case_when
penguins_raw %>%
  mutate(Sex = case_when(Sex == "MALE" ~ 1,
                         Sex == "FEMALE" ~ 0,
                         TRUE ~ NA_real_))
  
# like for method 1 (previous code) save results to keep changes and compare
```

:::{.callout-note}
With `case_when()` each `logical condition ~ value` pair acts like *if â†’ then*:

- for each row, R looks if the condition is TRUE: "*If* you find the value MALE in Sex, *then* convert it to 1"
- `TRUE ~ NA_real_` tells R: â€œ*If* no previous condition was met, *then* return NA as as a number"
:::

---

## ðŸ’» Practice Recoding Variables

- Use `count()` to check the variable `Species` in `penguins_raw` 
- Pick method 1 or method 2 to recode the values of that variable into Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo 
- Save the result to a new object
- Use `count()` to verify both results

Once done, copy your code [here](https://codeshare.io/29X3QM){target="_blank"} to share it.

<!--

# Method 1: RECODE

penguins_raw %>% count(Species)

p <- penguins_raw %>%
  mutate(Species = recode(Species,
    "Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)" = "Adelie",
    "Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)" = "Chinstrap",
    "Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)" = "Gentoo"
  ))

p %>% count(Species)


# Method 2: CASE_WHEN

penguins_raw %>% count(Species)

p2 <- penguins_raw %>%
  mutate(Species = case_when(
    Species == "Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)" ~ "Adelie",
    Species == "Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)" ~ "Chinstrap",
    Species == "Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)" ~ "Gentoo",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))

p2 %>% count(Species)

-->

---

## The Role of mutate in Recoding

#### `rename()`  
  - **Specific use: change column names**  
  - It changes the column's name, but leaves the columnâ€™s values unchanged

#### `mutate()`  
  - **Many uses: create new columns or modify existing columns values**  
  - It changes the column's values, potentially can also rename the column

:::{.callout-note}
For recoding, we use `mutate()` because our first goal is changing the *column's values*. We learned two methods:

- Method 1: `mutate(Sex = recode(Sex, "MALE" = 1, "FEMALE" = 0))`  
- Method 2: `mutate(Sex = case_when(sex == "MALE" ~ 1, sex == "FEMALE" ~ 0))`

## Rename vs Recode: Syntax Reference

| Function       | What It Changes    | Syntax + Example                                                | Tips                                                             |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rename()`     | Column names       | `rename(new_name = old_name)`  <br> `rename(notes = Comments)` | No quotes around variable names                                  |
| `recode()`     | Column values      | `recode(variable, "old" = new)`  <br> `recode(Sex, "MALE" = 1)` | Use quotes around variable values if they are character             |
| `case_when()`  | Column values      | `case_when(variable == "old" ~ new)` <br> `case_when(Sex == "MALE" ~ 1)` | Use quotes around variable values if they are character |

:::{.callout-note}
All recoding is typically done inside `mutate()`.

# 2. Syntactic vs. Non-syntactic Variable Names {.slide .center .middle}

---

## Syntactic (Valid) Variable Names in R

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Valid Names in R:
- Use letters, numbers, and the symbols `.` or `_`
- But cannot start with a number or symbol

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Examples of Valid Names:
```
flipper_length_mm
flipper.length.mm
flipper.length_mm     # valid but poor style
FlipperLengthMm       # valid but poor style
```
:::
:::

---

## Non-syntactic (Invalid) Variable Names in R

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### What Makes a Name Invalid:
- Contains spaces or symbols
- Starts with a number or symbol
- Uses reserved words (e.g., `TRUE`, `NULL`, `if`, `function`)
- Type `?Reserved` in the Console for the full list
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Examples of Invalid Names:
```
Flipper Length (mm)
@_flipper_length_mm
flipper_ length_mm
flipper-length-mm
.flipper.length.mm
```
:::
:::

---

## ðŸ’» Practice: Syntactic and Non-Syntactic Names

Which of the following are valid names?

- `3_religion`
- `#3_religion`
- `q3_religion`
- `q3.religion`
- `q3-religion`
- `q3 religion`
- `TRUE`

:::{.callout-tip}
For best coding style, use snake_case for all your variables names and keep them to three words maximum. Example: `q3_religion`
<!-- Check using `make.names()` in R or try using them in a `select()` call. -->
:::

---

## How to Handle Non-syntactic Names â€” and Why It Matters

**You should avoid creating non-syntactic names**, BUT youâ€™ll often encounter them,  especially in datasets not created in R (from Excel or other external sources). If you donâ€™t handle them properly, R will throw errors when you try to use them.

### What to Do:

**1. Use backticks to refer to them (e.g., `` `Flipper Length (mm)` ``)**  
**2. Use `rename()` to change them to syntactic names**

*Non-syntactic names will break code if you forget to wrape them in backticks, so renaming avoids issues.*

---

## Working with Non-syntactic Names in Practice

Imagine you are working on political ideology by country, assembled by someone else. The data are in Excel and when you imported them in R they look like this:

```r
df <- tibble(country = c("Italy", "Germany", "France", "Italy", "United States"),
                  `4 ideology` = c("communism", "fascism", "anarchism", "fascism", "capitalism"))
```

<br>

To use the non-syntactic variable name without changing it and without errors, you must use backticks:

```r
select(df, `4 ideology`)
```
</br>

---

## ðŸ’» Practice: Syntactic & Non-syntactic Variable Names

Try this in R:

- Use `glimpse(penguins_raw)` or `str(penguins_raw)` and identify non-syntactic variables names in this raw dataset
- Pick one of them, and try accessing it with `select()` without backticks: what happens?
- Use `rename()` to give the variable a syntactic valid name
- Save the result to a new object
- Verify the name was changed and you can now access it

Once done, copy your code [here](https://codeshare.io/29X3QM){target="_blank"} to share it.

<!--

glimpse(penguins_raw)
select(penguins_raw, `Flipper Length (mm)`)
x <- rename(penguins_raw, flipper_length_mm = `Flipper Length (mm)`)
glimpse(x)


# 1.
select(df, 4 ideology)
select(df, "4 ideology")
# 2. 
rename(df, ideology = `4 ideology`)
-->


# 3. Missing Data {.slide .center .middle}

---

## What Are Missing Data?

R distinguishes two types of missing data:

- **Explicit missing**: visible `NA` or `NaN` values in the dataset
- **Implicit missing**: data that was never recorded

In this course, we focus on **explicit** missing data. For implicit missing data, see [R for Data Science Chapter 18](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/missing-values)

:::{.callout-note}
Explicit = value is missing as `NA` (Not Available) or `NaN` (Not a Number)  
Implicit = value was never recorded (row or cell is absent)
:::

<!--
- `NA` = Not Available (general-purpose missing value)  
- `NaN` = Not a Number (typically from invalid math like `0/0` or `0 * Inf`)  
- Both behave similarly, but `NaN` specifically signals a **computational error**
See [Ch. 12.2.2](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/logicals#sec-na-comparison) for how `NA` behaves in comparisons.
:::
-->

---

## How Missing Data Behave

Any operation involving a missing value will also return a missing value (see [Chapter 12.2.2 Missing values](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/logicals#sec-na-comparison) for more):

```r
NA > 5

sum(c(3, 1, 4, NA)
sum(c(3, 1, 4, NA), na.rm = TRUE)

mean(c(3,1,4,NA))
mean(c(3, 1, 4, NA), na.rm = TRUE)  
```

---

## Common Ways to Handle Missing Data

Weâ€™ll review three main tools:

1. `is.na()` â€“ to detect missing values
2. `na.rm = TRUE` â€“ to ignore missing values 
3. `drop_na()` â€“ to remove missing values

<!-- All are for working with **explicit** missing values -->

---

## 1. Detect Missing Data with is.na(): 

**Use `is.na()` to find the missing values in a specific variable.** It returns `TRUE` for missing values, and `FALSE` otherwise.

Check for missing values in the `penguins_raw` dataset:

```r
# using base R syntax
sum(is.na(penguins_raw$Sex))
table(is.na(penguins_raw$Sex))

# using tidyverse syntax
penguins_raw %>% summarize(sum(is.na(Sex)))
penguins_raw  %>% count(is.na(Sex)) 

# filter rows where sex is missing
filter(penguins_raw, is.na(Sex))    # correct  
filter(penguins_raw, Sex == NA)     # incorrect
```

<!-- spend time on this code, add variable names, change df order, etc. -->

---

## 2. Ignore Missing Data with na.rm = TRUE 

**Use `na.rm = TRUE` to exclude missing values when performing calculations.** Often used with `summarize()` when calculating things like mean, sum, standard deviation.

```r
penguins_raw %>% summarize(avg_mass = mean(`Body Mass (g)`, na.rm = TRUE))
penguins_raw %>% summarize(sum_mass = sum(`Body Mass (g)`, na.rm = TRUE))
```

<!-- show the difference with and without the na.rm = TRUE and try change it to FALSE-->

<br>

:::{.callout-tip}
The command `na.rm = TRUE` does not remove missing data from the variable(s), it just skips them for that operation, but they are not dropped!
:::
 
</br>

---

## 3. Remove Missing Data with drop_na()

**Use `drop_na()` to remove rows with missing values.** Either across all columns or in a specific column.

Drop missing values in one specific column (preferred):

```r
penguins_raw %>%
  drop_na(`Body Mass (g)`) %>%
  summarize(avg_mass = mean(`Body Mass (g)`))
```

<!-- show you can drop_na() all or you can add more variables like 
drop_na(`Body Mass (g)`, Sex) etc. -->

<br>

:::{.callout-warning}
Be careful with `drop_na()` as it removes entire rows, which may unintentionally filter out relevant data. Check which variable(s) you are dropping, and avoid using it blindly across all columns.
:::

</br>

---

## ðŸ’» Practice: Handling Missing Data

0. **Rename:** use the `penguins_raw` dataset and rename `Flipper Length (mm)` to `flipper_length_mm`. Save the result as a new dataframe, e.g., `penguins_clean` or `p` 

Use the new dataframe with the renamed variable for the tasks below:

1. **Detect missing values:** use `is.na()` and `sum()` to count how many are missing in the variable flipper length

2. **Exclude missing from calculations:** use `na.rm = TRUE` inside `mean()` to calculate the average flipper length

3. **Drop missing values:** use `drop_na()` to remove rows with missing values in flipper length

Once done, [share your code here](https://codeshare.io/29X3QM){target="_blank"}.


<!--
# 0. Rename
p <- penguins_raw %>% rename(flipper_length_mm = `Flipper Length (mm)`)

# 1. Detect missing values
p %>% summarize(n_missing = sum(is.na(flipper_length_mm)))

# 2. Exclude missing values from calculation
p %>% summarize(avg_flipper = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))

# 3. Drop missing values and calculate again
p %>% drop_na(flipper_length_mm)
-->

---

## Ways to Fill or Replace Missing Data

Main functions to replace or fill missing values:

- `replace_na()` â€“ replace missing values with a specified value  
- `fill()` â€“ carry values forward or backward (from the package `tidyr`)  
- `coalesce()` â€“ return the first non-missing value across multiple columns

See [Chapter 18](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/missing-values) of *R for Data Science* for more.

<!-- NOTE: REMOVE THIS PART FOR CSP, KEEP FOR CSS 
ALSO EXPAND THE EXAMPLE ON HOW TO REPLACE OR REFILL MISSING DATA

## Factors and Empty Groups

Example from [Chapter 18](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/missing-values) of *R for Data Science*.

Create a dataset with with one variable defined as factor with two levels (yes and no):

```r
health <- tibble(
  name   = c("Ikaia", "Oletta", "Leriah", "Dashay", "Tresaun"),
  smoker = factor(c("no", "no", "no", "no", "no"), levels = c("yes", "no")),
  age    = c(34, 88, 75, 47, 56)
)
health
```

---

## Counting with Dropped vs. Retained Factor Levels

Without `.drop = FALSE`, unobserved factor levels are excluded:

```r
health |> count(smoker)
```

With `.drop = FALSE`, all factor levels are preserved (keeps all groups, even those not observed in the data since here they are all non-smokers)

```r
health |> count(smoker, .drop = FALSE)
```

---

## This Matters for Plotting

Compare these two codes.

The default behavior excludes empty levels from the plot:
```r
ggplot(health, aes(x = smoker)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete()
```

Force display of all factor levels, including empty ones:
```r
ggplot(health, aes(x = smoker)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE)
```
-->
